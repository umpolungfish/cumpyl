# Stub Development Plan

## Current Status
We have successfully proven that our approach to stub integration works with a simple exit stub. However, our more complex ELF unpacking stub is causing segmentation faults.

## Issues Identified
1. The complex ELF stub is segfaulting when executed
2. The stub is trying to do too much complex memory management
3. The parameter extraction and base address calculation may be incorrect
4. The memory protection handling might have issues

## Plan for Fixing the ELF Stub

### Phase 1: Simplify and Debug
1. Create a minimal version of the ELF stub that:
   - Can correctly retrieve its base address
   - Can read parameters from fixed offsets
   - Can locate the payload section
   - Exits gracefully with a known code

### Phase 2: Implement Core Functionality Step by Step
1. Add memory allocation functionality
2. Implement parameter de-obfuscation
3. Add CA engine functionality
4. Implement ChaCha20-Poly1305 decryption
5. Add memory protection handling
6. Implement jump to OEP

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
1. Test each component individually
2. Integrate components step by step
3. Test with various binary formats
4. Add error handling

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Create a minimal debug stub that can:
   - Correctly find its base address
   - Read parameters from fixed offsets
   - Print debug information (if possible)
   - Exit gracefully

2. Use debugging tools to understand where the current stub is failing:
   - Use gdb to trace execution
   - Use objdump to examine the compiled stub
   - Use readelf to verify section structure

3. Fix the base address calculation:
   - The current method of finding the ELF header may not be working correctly
   - Need to ensure we're calculating the correct base address

4. Simplify memory management:
   - Use a simpler heap implementation
   - Reduce complexity of memory protection handling

5. Verify parameter embedding:
   - Ensure the packer is correctly embedding parameters
   - Verify the stub is reading parameters correctly

## Technical Approach

### Base Address Calculation
The current approach in the stub uses a function to find the base address by searching backwards for the ELF magic number. This approach might not be working correctly.

Alternative approaches:
1. Use the address of the _start function and calculate offset to base
2. Use a fixed offset from a known location
3. Have the packer calculate and embed the base address

### Parameter Retrieval
The current stub tries to retrieve parameters from fixed offsets. We need to verify:
1. The packer is embedding parameters at the correct offsets
2. The stub is reading from the correct offsets
3. The parameter de-obfuscation is working correctly

### Memory Management
The current stub has a simple heap implementation. We should:
1. Simplify the heap implementation
2. Add better error checking
3. Ensure memory is properly aligned

### Error Handling
The current stub has minimal error handling. We should:
1. Add checks for all critical operations
2. Implement a simple error reporting mechanism
3. Ensure graceful failure when errors occur
