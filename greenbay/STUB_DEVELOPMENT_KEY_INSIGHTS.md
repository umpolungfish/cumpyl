# Stub Development - Key Insights

## Problem Identified
We were experiencing segmentation faults when executing packed binaries with our simple exit stub, even though the stub code itself was correct.

## Root Cause
The issue was with changing the binary file type from DYN (Position-Independent Executable) to EXEC (Executable). While we thought this would improve compatibility, it actually caused the binary to be loaded and executed differently, leading to segmentation faults.

## Solution
Keep the binary as a DYN file with its interpreter. This allows our stub code to execute correctly within the normal execution context provided by the dynamic loader.

## Key Lessons
1. **PIE vs EXEC**: Position-Independent Executables (PIE) work correctly with our stub approach
2. **Dynamic Loading**: The dynamic loader provides a proper execution context for our stub code
3. **Entry Point**: Setting the entry point to our stub section works correctly with DYN binaries
4. **Compatibility**: DYN binaries are widely supported and don't require special handling

## Implementation Changes
- Removed the line that changed binary type from DYN to EXEC
- Verified that the entry point is correctly set to our stub section
- Confirmed that section flags are properly set for executable code

## Verification
- Simple exit stub now correctly exits with code 42
- No segmentation faults occur
- Binary is properly formed and executable
