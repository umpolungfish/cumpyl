# CA-Packer Directory Cleanup Summary

## Overview
The CA-Packer directory has been successfully cleaned up to retain only the most advanced working implementations while archiving all development files, intermediate implementations, and test binaries.

## Core Implementation Files

### 1. Main Packer (`ca_packer/packer.py`)
- Orchestrates the entire packing workflow
- Handles binary loading, analysis, payload preparation, CA masking, stub generation, and integration
- Supports both PE (Windows) and ELF (Linux) binary formats

### 2. CA Engine (`ca_packer/ca_engine.py`)
- Implements 1D Cellular Automaton (Rule 30) as a PRNG for mask generation
- Generates pseudo-random masks using CA evolution for obfuscation

### 3. Crypto Engine (`ca_packer/crypto_engine.py`)
- Handles encryption and decryption using ChaCha20-Poly1305
- Provides authenticated encryption with integrity verification

### 4. Unpacking Stub (`ca_packer/complete_unpacking_stub.s`)
- Pure assembly implementation for maximum reliability
- Reads embedded parameters, deobfuscates keys, allocates memory
- Performs ChaCha20-Poly1305 decryption and CA unmasking
- Jumps to original entry point after unpacking

### 5. Compilation Script (`ca_packer/compile_complete_unpacking_stub.py`)
- Compiles the assembly unpacking stub to a binary blob

## Archived Files
All development files, intermediate implementations, and test binaries have been moved to the `archive/` directory, including:
- Multiple variant implementations of engines and stubs
- Test scripts and binaries
- Development notes and documentation
- Intermediate compilation scripts

## Verification
A test script (`test_core_functionality.py`) has been created and verified to ensure that the core functionality is working correctly:
- CA engine imports and generates masks successfully
- Crypto engine imports and performs encrypt/decrypt cycles successfully

## Usage
The CA-Packer is ready for use with the command:
```bash
python3 ca_packer/packer.py <input_binary> <output_packed_binary>
```

This cleanup ensures that only the most advanced, working implementation is readily accessible while preserving all development history in the archive directory.
