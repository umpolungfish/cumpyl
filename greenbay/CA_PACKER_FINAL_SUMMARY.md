## Conclusion

The CA-Packer project represents a successful implementation of a novel binary protection technique that combines the mathematical properties of cellular automata with proven cryptographic methods. The pure assembly implementation ensures reliable execution across different environments, while the modular design allows for easy extension and enhancement.

The project has demonstrated that it is possible to create a robust binary packer using unconventional obfuscation techniques while maintaining compatibility with standard encryption methods. This approach offers a unique combination of security features that make reverse engineering significantly more challenging.

The development process has also highlighted the importance of careful implementation, particularly when dealing with low-level code execution in packed binaries. The switch from C-based to pure assembly stubs was a key breakthrough that enabled reliable execution of the unpacking process.
