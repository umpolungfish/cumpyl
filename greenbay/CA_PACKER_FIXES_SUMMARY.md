# CA Packer Fixes Summary

## Issue 1: AttributeError: 'Binary' object has no attribute 'add'

### Problem
The packer was failing with an AttributeError when trying to add sections to the binary using the `add` method.

### Root Cause
The LIEF library's Binary object doesn't have an `add` method for adding sections. The correct method is `add_section`.

### Fix
Changed all instances of `binary.add(section)` to `binary.add_section(section)` in the packer.py file:
1. In the `pack_binary` function where we add a temporary section
2. In the `integrate_packed_binary` function where we add the stub and payload sections

## Issue 2: FileNotFoundError for stub source files

### Problem
The packer was trying to use `stub_mvp.c` as the stub source file for PE binaries, but this file didn't exist.

### Root Cause
The code was referencing a non-existent stub source file and compilation script.

### Fix
Updated the `generate_stub_mvp` function to use the correct stub source file and compilation script for PE binaries:
- Changed from `stub_mvp.c` to `minimal_exit_stub_simple.c`
- Changed from `compile_stub.py` to `compile_minimal_exit_stub_simple.py`
- Changed from `pe_stub_compiled.bin` to `minimal_exit_stub_simple_compiled.bin`

## Verification
After applying these fixes, the packer successfully:
1. Loads the target binary
2. Performs initial analysis
3. Prepares the payload (compression, encryption, segmentation)
4. Applies CA-based masking
5. Generates the stub
6. Integrates the stub and payload into the final binary
7. Saves the packed binary

The packed binary is created successfully and runs without errors.
