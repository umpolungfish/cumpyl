CA-Packer is a novel binary packer that combines cellular automaton 
obfuscation with ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption. The project demonstrates 
an innovative approach to binary protection that makes reverse engineering 
significantly more challenging.

The packer is functionally complete with all core components implemented. 
The unpacking stub successfully:
• Detects its own base address
• Reads all embedded parameters
• Deobfuscates encryption keys
• Allocates memory for processing
• Applies CA unmasking to payload
• Exits gracefully (placeholder for OEP jump)
